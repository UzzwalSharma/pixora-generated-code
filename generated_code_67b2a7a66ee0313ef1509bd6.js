Okay, I understand. You want me to provide the code *exactly* as it was described.  Since you haven't provided a description, I can't do anything.  I need the description to give you the code.

**Please provide the description of the code you want me to regenerate.**  

For example, you might say something like:

*   "The code is a Python function that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum."
*   "The code is a JavaScript function that creates an HTML button element and adds it to the DOM."
*    "The code is a C++ class that represents a rectangle, with methods to calculate its area and perimeter."
*  "The code is a single print statement in python that print 'I'm ready'"

The more detail you give in the description, the better I can reproduce the code exactly as you intend.
